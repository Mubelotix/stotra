Stotra is a multiplayer **STO**ck **TRA**ading simulator that allows users to engage in real-time virtual trading of stocks, currencies, and cryptocurrencies. With Stotra, users can practice trading without risking real money, making it an ideal platform for beginners to learn the ropes of trading. The project is powered by AWS, utilizing Amplify for the React frontend and Elastic Cloud Compute for the Express API.

I built Stotra in 70 hours split across 3 weeks of design, development, and deployment. I set development goals and stayed on top of them with Trello and tracked time spent on each portion with Toggl Track.

## Features ‚ú®

- ü™ô Real-time virtual trading of stocks, currencies, and cryptocurrencies
- üåê Multiplayer leaderboard for competitive trading with friends
- üìä Interactive charts and visualizations for better decision-making
- üóûÔ∏è Access to financial news for informed trading
- üé® Beautiful design with dark mode and customizable accent color
- üì± Responsive design for trading on-the-go

## Design üñåÔ∏è

The design was inspired by [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) and [this Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/19488130-GoStock-Stock-Market-Dashboard). The frontend uses Chakra UI for a consistent and minimal design, with [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) for the headings and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for the body text.

The accent color defaults to Chakra's "Pink 500", which can be changed in the app to any of [Chakra's sleek colors](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/theme#colors). Using the toggle in the top right, one can switch between light and dark mode, as shown in the "Sign up" screenshot above.

## Get Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.18+)
- MongoDB
  - I used [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/get-started) for the demo version

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/spikecodes/stotra.git
$ cd stotra
```

2. Install NPM packages for both the frontend and backend

```sh
$ cd app
$ npm install
$ cd ../server
$ npm install
```

3. Next step will require a mongodb instance. You can use docker to spin up a local instance:

```sh
$ docker compose -f dev-docker-compose.yml up
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

```py
STOTRA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://devuser:devpassword@127.0.0.1:27017/users?authSource=admin # example
STOTRA_USERNAME_HEADER=x-username
STOTRA_STARTING_CASH=100000
STOTRA_LOGIN_URL=https://your-authentication-proxy.com/login
STOTRA_LOGOUT_URL=https://your-authentication-proxy.com/logout
# Optional: (for real-time news and stock data)
STOTRA_NEWSFILTER_API=<api key for news descriptions>
STOTRA_ALPHAVANTAGE_API=<api key for real-time stock data>
```

5. Run the frontend and backend in separate terminals

```bash
$ cd app
$ npm run dev

> stotra-frontend@0.0.0 dev
> vite

  VITE v4.4.9  ready in 503 ms
